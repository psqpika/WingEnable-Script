# WingEnable-Script
WingEnable Script is a script that allows you to enable something when you press the "A" button on your oculus controller. This works for any XR type game.


# To Use it

Drag the XR camera into the slot where it says "XR Camera"
Drag the two items you would like to enable in the "Right Wing" and "Left Wing" slots.
This can be used for wings for flying, or anything else that needs to be activated when pressing the "A" button.
